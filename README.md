Objective:
The goal of this project is to build an automated data preprocessing pipeline that transforms raw data into a clean, standardized format suitable for machine learning models. The pipeline processes numerical and categorical data by applying standardization and one-hot encoding techniques to ensure consistency and readiness for model training.

Key Components:

Data Ingestion:

The pipeline begins by loading raw data from an external source, specifically a CSV file (example_data.csv) stored in Google Drive. This file is expected to contain a mixture of numerical and categorical features.
Data Preprocessing/Transformation:

Numerical Features:
The numerical features are standardized using StandardScaler from scikit-learn. This ensures that the features are scaled to have zero mean and unit variance, which is often important for machine learning algorithms.
Categorical Features:
Categorical features are transformed using OneHotEncoder, converting them into binary (one-hot) encoded columns. This is essential because many machine learning algorithms require categorical variables to be represented numerically.
Column-wise Transformation:

The preprocessing steps for numerical and categorical features are applied separately using ColumnTransformer. This ensures that each set of features is handled appropriately (standardization for numerical data and one-hot encoding for categorical data).
Pipeline Integration:

A Pipeline is created to chain together the preprocessing steps. This guarantees that the preprocessing is applied in a consistent order, ensuring that the data is transformed in a reproducible manner.
Data Output:

The transformed data is converted back into a pandas DataFrame. The resulting dataset, which now contains standardized numerical features and one-hot encoded categorical features, is then saved to a new CSV file (processed_data.csv) for further analysis or machine learning model training.
Automation:

By using a pipeline, the entire data transformation process is automated, reducing the potential for human error and ensuring that data is consistently processed in the same way each time.
Technologies Used:
Python: Core programming language.
Pandas: For data manipulation and transformation.
Scikit-learn: Used for the StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder, ColumnTransformer, and Pipeline to facilitate data preprocessing.
Google Colab: The project uses Google Colab for running the code and storing the processed data on Google Drive.
Applications:
This project serves as a foundational step for preparing datasets for machine learning tasks. It provides an efficient way to preprocess raw data, ensuring that the data is clean and in the right format for model training. The pipeline can be extended to handle additional preprocessing tasks, feature engineering, or even integrating real-time data streams for online machine learning applications.
